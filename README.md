# 🗒️ Feedback Annotator – In-Context Comments for Web Apps

## Problem

Giving UI feedback during QA or UAT often becomes inefficient and fragmented. Users or QA testers must:
- Take a screenshot manually,
- Mark it with annotations,
- Send it over WhatsApp or email, and
- Follow up with additional clarification.

This process results in:
- Lost or unclear feedback context,
- Extra coordination effort between QA, PM, and developers,
- Slower iteration cycles.

## Solution

A **Chrome Extension** that enables direct, contextual feedback on live web apps:

- 🖱️ Right-click on any UI element to add a comment directly on the page.
- 📍 The feedback is saved along with the DOM position or CSS selector.
- 📧 Comments can be emailed to developers or saved into a feedback dashboard automatically.

This solution **streamlines the communication** between QA, PM, and Developers in a structured and asynchronous way.
